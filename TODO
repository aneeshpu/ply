- Remove 'from import *' in code
- BUG: Make _mutate_series_file support recursive series files
- Make _applied_patches return a list, generator is a hassle

WISHLIST

- Use argparse in bin/ply
- Show which patches are being applied in reqular mode. (-q to supress, -v for
  even more info)
- Create a diff utility to show changes aginst working repo (needed so
  pull-requests to the Patch-Repo are more human readable)
- Hide errors from `git am` when merge fails, we supply our own
    - Use --resolvemsg when `am` fails
- Differentiate a restore versus a refresh. Restore is point-in-time fixed to
  a particular base-commit of the working-repo. Refresh isn't and is free to
  make changes to the patch-repo.
