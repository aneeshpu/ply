- Hide errors from `git am` when merge fails, we supply our own
    - Use --resolvemsg when `am` fails
- Allow for recursive series files like pip-requires:

  -r mysubdir/series

  or just subdir with `series` implied:

  mysubdir/
- Make _applied_patches return a list, generator is a hassle

WISHLIST

- Use argparse in bin/ply
- ply graph - generate DOT file graph on dependencies
- Show which patches are being applied in reqular mode. (-q to supress, -v for
  even more info)
